Casio CZ Synthesizer Presets

This is a compilation of Casio CZ Synthesizer Presets from the CZ-230S synthesizer exported to sysex format for 
the Casio CZ-101 and CZ-1000. The Casio CZ-230S was a pre-prograpped veriosn of the CZ series that included a rudimentary
drum machine. The 99 patches are compatible with the CZ-1000 but only the last four are editable and only over sysex. 

These 99 presets are here raw and also packaged together into import files that can be used directly. The import files are 
broken into groups of 16 (as that's all the CZ-101/CZ-1000 can do). So there are seven different files to play with. These 99 
presets represent a good starting point for editing and creating custom patches on the CZ series synths.
